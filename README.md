# ProjectAcquire
This project's goal was to fully implement the boardgame Acquire. This incudes all gameplay mechanics and a functioning UI.
## Installation
Simple installation
1. Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/Team-P-06/ProjectAcquire.git`
2. run `gradle build`
3. finally run `gradle run` to begin the game
## Usage
Once installed a UI will activate that will ask if you would ike to start a new game, load game or exit.

When clicking in new game a game will start with the gameboard being shown.

The gameboard is on the top left, player information on the bottom left, Hotel information on the top right and any actions when available on the bottom right.

NOTE: The logic of the program is implemented but it still does not properly run a full game. Thus in this current build it can not be used to run a proper game of Acquire.
